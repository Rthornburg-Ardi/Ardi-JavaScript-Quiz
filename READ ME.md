# Challenge 4

## Description

This is  a short quiz about JavaScript. It is a timed quiz, and time is deducted when a question is answered incorrectly. At the end of the game, you can enter your name and save it to the high scores. You can also view the high scores when you click the high scores button.
This project was meant to test my knowledge of complex JavaScript through arrays, listening events, and timer functions.
I learned how to take different concepts of JavaScript and combine them to create a fun interactive event.

## Usage

The quiz is started when the Start Quiz button is clicked. A multiple-choice question will appear, and when answered, the next question will appear. If a question is answered incorrectly, time is deducted from the timer. The quiz is finished when all questions are answered, or the timer runs out. Then, the user is prompted to submit their name to the high scores board. That board is accessed through the high score button in the top left.

The link takes you to the quiz which looks like this.

## Credits

Using what I learned in class, I developed this on my own, with Nick (the TA) helping me find why my start button wasn't working and syntax error.
