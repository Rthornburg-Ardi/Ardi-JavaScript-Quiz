# Challenge 4

## Description

This is  a short quiz about JavaScript. It is a timed quiz that when a question is asnwered incorrectly time is deducted. At the end of the game you can enter your name and save it to the highscores. You are also able to view the high scores when you click the highscores button.
This project was meant to test my knowledge of complex JavaScript through arrays, listening events, and timer functions.
I learned how to take different concepts of JavaScript and combine them to create a fun interactive event.

If a question is answered inccorectly then time is deducted off of the timer. The quiz is finished when either all questions are ansered or the timer runs out. Then the user is prompted for their name to submit to the high scores board. That board is accessed through the high score button in the top left.

The link takes you to the quiz which looks like this.

I developed this on my own using what I learned in class, with Nick (the ta) helping me find why my start button wasn't working, syntax error.
